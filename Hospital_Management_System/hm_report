1. Introduction
   - Purpose: The purpose of the Hospital Management System is to provide an efficient and comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of hospital operations, including admin management, doctor management, patient management, and appointment management.
   - Scope: The system will allow administrators to manage hospital staff, doctors to manage patient appointments, and patients to schedule appointments and access their medical records.
   - Objectives: The objectives of the system are to streamline hospital operations, improve appointment scheduling and management, enhance communication between staff and patients, and maintain accurate and up-to-date medical records.

2. System Architecture
   - Frontend: The frontend of the system will be developed using HTML, CSS, and React.js, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface.
   - Backend: The backend will be built using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Java, handling the business logic and data processing.
   - Database: The system will utilize MySQL as the database management system for storing and retrieving data.

3. Technologies Used
   - Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap
   - Backend Technologies: PHP
   - Database Technology: MySQL

4. System Components
   - Admin Management: This component will enable administrators to manage hospital staff, including adding, editing, and deleting admin accounts.
   - Doctor Management: This component will allow doctors to register, view, and update their information, including specialization details.
   - Patient Management: Patients will have access to register, view, and update their personal details and medical records.
   - Appointment Management: This component will facilitate the scheduling and management of appointments between doctors and patients.
   - Specialties Management: Administrators can manage the list of specialties offered by the hospital and assign them to doctors.

5. Database Design
   - Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): A visual representation of the relationships between the entities (tables) in the database.
   - Table Structures: Detailed descriptions of the database tables, including field names, data types, and relationships.

6. User Interfaces
   - Admin Dashboard: A user-friendly interface for administrators to manage hospital staff, specialties, and view system reports.
   - Doctor Dashboard: A dedicated interface for doctors to manage appointments, view patient records, and update their information.
